# Snake

This is a simple snake game.

## Scenario

The snake game is still incomplete. However, here, we are concerned with updating the score as a snake eats each piece of food.

Eating each piece of food gives the player 10 points. If the player eats 10 pieces of food, the user gets 100 points and so on.

## Objective

Update the score as the snake eats a piece of food. Update this information at the bottom of the snake viewport.

## Suggestions

* Consider committing a TODO
* Commit regularly
* Use good commit messages
* Do not break existing functionality
* **Don't** use ```window.alert```
* Consider using ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer <port_of_your_choice>``` to host the game locally
